# FMS-Banking
FMS stands for - Financial Management System. This is a finance management app 
I created as my Database Systems Final project.

Currently it is only set to make new user accounts, associate bank account 
types with users main accounts, make and record transactions with other accounts 
within the programs database. It does feature logging in, 
protection of user sessions and error handling for accounts that don't exist when
making transactions.

The database does come with two users already added for testing puproses.
